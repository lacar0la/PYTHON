# Flowers CSV
## CSV_manipulation.py
We're working with a list of flowers and some information about each one. The create_file function
writes this information to a CSV file. The contents_of_file function reads this file into recors
and returns the information in a nicely formatted block.

## CSV_Reader.py
Using the CSV file of flowers again, process the data without turning the file information into a dictionary.
